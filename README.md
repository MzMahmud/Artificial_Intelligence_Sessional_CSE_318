CSE 318: Artificial Intelligence Sessional
=========================================
This was a course in my Level 3 Term 2.The name clearly suggests this is a course on Artificial Intelligence(AI). In the theory class we learnt about basics of different AI techniques.
The sessional was all about implementing some techniques.

We were given 4 assignments on different topics.

The missionaries and cannibals problem
-----------------------------------------
In this assignment, I solved the general version of famous **Missionaries and Cannibals Problem** with **m** missionaries,**c** cannibals and boat capacity **k** using Search Breadth First Search(**BFS**) and Depth First Search(**DFS**) and compared their performance.

n-Puzzle
--------
In this assignment, I solved the general version of a famous game 8-puzzle, n-puzzle with **A\* search algorithm**.
We compared performance of different heuristics:
* Hamming distance
* Manhattan distance
* Linear Conflict 

Traveling Salesperson Problem
-----------------------------
In this assignment, I implemented The **Nearest Neighbour Heuristic(NNH)** and **Savings Heuristic (SH)** which are constructive algorithms. Also, improved the attained solution by NNH and SH by **k-opt iterative improvement algorithm**(for k = 2).to solve the NP-complete problem **Traveling Salesperson Problem**. 

Mancala
-------
In this assignment, I have built an AI to play the game of **Mancala** by adversarial search algorithms.
To be more specific I used **minimax algorithm**
with **alpha-beta pruning** with various heuristics.
